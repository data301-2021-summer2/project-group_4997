## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{Air quality has becoming becoming more and more of a pressing issue in recent years. I had some personal experience with poor air quality in the past couple years as I took a year off school to travel. Some parts of China and Southeast Asia, specifically the philipinnes, had caught my interest in looking at air quality. So, I thought it would be interesting to study the data.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{My data is an excel spread sheet containing 14 columns and 9358 rows. The data describes the abundance of many chemical compunds in the air such as Carbon Monoxide, Nitrous Oxide etc. measured in milgrams per metre cubed. Data was collected by humans using sensor technology called "Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device". Other data including temperature, relative humidity and absolute humidity were recorded to see if any correlations could be observed. The data is public, however, exclusively to be used for research purposes.}
